## Learning Task: Understand the BottleCase class

The Java code below implements a bottle case to collect refund bottles. Read and run the code to obtain an understandig. Describe the functionality provided by this class. 

``` java
package org.htwd.pool.o0;

public class BottleCase {
    private final double BOTTLEVALUE = 0.08;
    private final int CAPACITY;
    private int count;

    public BottleCase(int capacity) {
        this.CAPACITY = capacity; 
        this.count = 0;
    }

    public void addMore(int n) {
        this.count = this.count + n;
    }

    public double getTotalValue() {
        double v = this.BOTTLEVALUE * this.count;
        return v;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BottleCase b = new BottleCase(20);
        b.addMore(8);
        System.out.println("EUR: " + 
		      b.getTotalValue());
    }

}
```

---------------------------------------

### Solution
This class models a bottle case to collect bottles for refund. The case has a defined capacity that gets set by the constructor. The initial bottle count is set to zero by the constructor. The value of a bottle is defined to 0.08. The addMore method increments the count of collected bottles by n. The getTotalValue method calculates the value of bottles that have been added to the case. The provided main-function demonstrates the usage of this class.

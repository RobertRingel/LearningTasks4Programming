## Learning Task: There is a problem with loop

The Java code below shows the main-function of class BottleCase in order to demonstrate the implementation of a while-loop. However the given implementation has a problem. Read the given code, run it, identify and fix the problem.

``` java
package org.htwd.pool.o0;

public class BottleCase {

...

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BottleCase b = new BottleCase(20);
        int num = 0;

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("How many people 	
			          collected bottles?");
        int people = sc.nextInt();
        sc.nextLine();
        
        while (people > 0) {
            System.out.println("Number of bottles to add?"); 
            num = sc.nextInt();
            sc.nextLine();
            b.addMore(num);
            people = people + 1;
        }

        System.out.println("We have total EUR: " 
            + b.getTotalValue());

        sc.close();
    }
}
```

---------------------------------------

### Solution

Since the line "people = people + 1" will increment the number of people the while-statement "while (people>0)" will never stop the loop. The line must be corrected to:  
people = people - 1

## Learning Task: Adding more and more bottles 

The Java code below shows the main-function of class BottleCase in order to demonstrate the implementation of a while-loop. Read the given code, run it and write some brief note to explain the function and the purpose of the while-loop.

``` java
package org.htwd.pool.o0;

public class BottleCase {

...

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BottleCase b = new BottleCase(20);
        int num = 0;

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("How many people 	
			          collected bottles?");
        int people = sc.nextInt();
        sc.nextLine();
        
        while (people > 0) {
            System.out.println("Number of bottles to add?"); 
            num = sc.nextInt();
            sc.nextLine();
            b.addMore(num);
            people = people - 1;
        }

        System.out.println("We have total EUR: " 
            + b.getTotalValue());

        sc.close();
    }
}
```

### Solution

The while loop is used to repeat a section of code. The given while loop allows to enter and add the number of bottles for a dedicated number of people. 
So as long as the number of people is greater zero, it will read the number of bottles as an integer from the console and it will perform the addMore-method. Very important: at the end of the loop the number of people is decremented by one - otherwise the loop would run endless.

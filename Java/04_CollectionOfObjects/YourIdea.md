Topic: storing objects in collections

## Learning Task: Your Idea

Design and implement a new class of your own that makes use of one of the Java collection classes. The collection class shall be used to store objects of another class. This can be a new own classes either or it can be a class from this task repository (such as Person, Employee, Account, Task or Book).

Develop an idea of the new class and explain it to another student.  
Then implement the new class and demonstrate and test its use within a main-method.

---------------------------------------

### Solution

Any Java class similar to the classes shown in this series of the task repository.

#### Previous Knowledge

bcm-1: basics of classes, public/private modifieres  
uob-1: basics of creating and using objects  
col-1, col-2: basics of the ArrayList and HashMap classes

#### Learning Activities

1) think of a potential useful class
2) explain the idea of the new class to another student  
3) implement the Java code of the new class
4) run the program to test it

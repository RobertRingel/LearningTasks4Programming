## Learning Task: Printing tickets

The Java code below implements a ticket generator. Read the code to obtain an understandig. Describe the functionality provided by this class and argument the different types of attribute modifiers.

Write a main-method to demonstrate the use of this class.

``` java
package org.htwd.pool.o1;

public class TicketGenerator {
    private static final String COMPANY = "iTicket Sales International Inc.";
    private final String ticketLabel;
    private int ticketCounter = 0;
    

    public TicketGenerator(String label) {
        this.ticketLabel = label;
    }

    public String getTicket() {
        this.ticketCounter++;
        String ticket = this.ticketLabel + ":" + this.ticketCounter;
        ticket = ticket + "\n" + TicketGenerator.COMPANY;
        return ticket;
    }

    public int getTicketCounter() {
        return this.ticketCounter;
    }
}
```

---------------------------------------

### Solution

The TicketGenerator is used to simulate the generation of unique strings that may serve as event tickets. The class constructor takes a string that names the event the tickets are made for. The class has an internal counter to count the number of generated tickets. The getTicket-method generates a string that contains the event name and the ticket number as well as the name of the company that created the ticket.

The sample implementation of a main-method is shown below - as well as argumentation of the attribute modifiers.

``` java
package org.htwd.pool.o1;

public class TicketGenerator {
    // constant public class string: name of the company
    public static final String COMPANY = "iTicket Sales International Inc.";

    // private constant string: name of the event
    private final String ticketLabel;

    // private int value: the current ticket count
    private int ticketCounter = 0;
    
    ...

   public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println(TicketGenerator.COMPANY);
        System.out.println("================================================\n");

        TicketGenerator g1 = new TicketGenerator("Queen_Forever_Wembley2025");
        int i = 23;
        while (i > 0) {
            System.out.println("Got a ticket:\n" + g1.getTicket());
            i--;
        }
        System.out.println("Ticket counter: " + g1.getTicketCounter());
    }
```

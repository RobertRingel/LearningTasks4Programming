## Learning Task: Your Idea

Design and implement a new class of your own that makes use of the concepts of abstract classes. 

Develop an idea of a new abstract class and one or two related sub-classes and explain it to another student.  
Then implement the new classes and demonstrate and test them within a main-method.

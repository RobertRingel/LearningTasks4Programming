Topic: using objects

## Learning Task: Your Idea

Design and implement a new class of your own as a composition or aggregation of at least two other classes. These other classes can be new own classes either or it can be classes from this task repository (such as Person, Employee, Account, Task or Book).

First design an UML class diagramm of your class. State clearly whether you will use aggregation or composition.  
Then implement the new class and demonstrate its use within a main-method.

Finally explain your new Java-class to another student.

---------------------------------------

### Solution

An UML class diagram and the related implementation similar to the sample code given in this series of the task repository.

#### Previous Knowledge

bcm-1: basics of classes, public/private modifieres  
uob-1: basics of creating and using objects  
uml-2: basics of UML class diagrams including class composition, aggregation

#### Learning Activities

1) thinking of a potential useful class
2) design the UML class diagram of the new class
3) implement the Java code of the new class
4) run the program to test it
5) explain the program to another student

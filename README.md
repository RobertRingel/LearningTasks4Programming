This task repository is a collection of learning tasks for basic Python programming. Its current status is: work in progress.

The collection of learning tasks may be used in task based learning methodic approaches such as 4C/ID (www.4cid.org). It can bee seen as a task set inspired by Astleitner (2006) and Stephenson's Python Workbook (2014). I have used similar sequences of learning tasks in my PhD work (Ringel, 2024b) here at the University of Applied Sciences in Dresden. I implemented these learning tasks in Jupyter Notebook as a digital learning environment (Ringel, 2024a).

This task repository aims the following goals:  
- source of inspiration to other teachers for designing own learning tasks
- pool of ready to use learning tasks for Python beginners classes
- source of samples for the six basic programming task typs proposed by Merriënboer and Kirschner (2018, p. 72)
- sharpen the sense for potential learning activities in learning programming (there is much more then wrting code)
- providing a range of potential real live topics to learn basic programming (there is much more then classic math tasks)
- example for the design and documentation of learning tasks

I would like to invite you to contribute to this collection of learning tasks - or to set-up a similar collection for a different programming language or another field in computer science (e.g. operation systems, data bases). 

Do not heasitate to give me feed-back regarding this task repository or share your experiences using these tasks.

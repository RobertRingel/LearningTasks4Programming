### Learning Task: Birthdays

The following Python program reads birthday data from a text file. The user
enters a particular date and the program prints the birthday data for this
specific date as it was read from the file.

Read the code and run it to obtain an understanding. Then write a similar
Python program for anonther use case - e.g. look-up a person's name to show the
phone number or email address.

``` python
file_name = 'Birthdays.txt'              # the file name
birthday_file = open(file_name, 'r')     # open file for reading

search_date = input('Requested date:')   # ask user for date

while True:                              # read file line by line
    line = birthday_file.readline()      # read one line from the file
    line = line.strip('\n')              # remove line break from line data
    if line == '':                       # empty line -> terminate reading
        break
    data = line.split('\t')              # split line data by '\t'
    if data[1] == search_date:           # check for requested date
        print(line)                      # print line

birthday_file.close()                    # close text file
```

#### Solution

``` python
file_name = 'Contacts.txt'               # the file name
contact_file = open(file_name, 'r')      # open file for reading

search_name = input('Requested name:')   # ask user for name

while True:                              # read file line by line
    line = contact_file.readline()       # read one line from the file
    line = line.strip('\n')              # remove line break from line data
    if line == '':                       # empty line -> terminate reading
        break
    data = line.split('\t')              # split line data by '\t'
    if data[0] == search_name:           # check for requested name
        print(line)                      # print line

contact_file.close()                     # close text file
```
... or any other similar Python program.

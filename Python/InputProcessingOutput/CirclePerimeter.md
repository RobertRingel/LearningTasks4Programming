### Learning Task: Calculation of a circle perimeter

What does the following program? 
Note your answer in short sentences.
Add comments to the end of line 2-4.


``` python
print("Calculation of a circle's perimeter")
d = 5         # ...
pi = 3.14     # ...
p = pi * d    # ...
print("Diameter  d:", d)
print("Perimeter p:", p)
print("----- Datentypen -----")
print("d: ", d, "data type:", type(d))
print("pi:", pi, "data type:", type(pi))
print("p :", p, "data type:", type(p))
```

##### Solution

The program calculates the perimeter of a circle for the diameter given by variable d.
It show the values and the data types of all used variables. 

``` python
print("Calculation of a circle's perimeter")
d = 5         # circle diameter
pi = 3.14     # pi - calculation constant for circles
p = pi * d    # calculation of the perimeter in variable p
...
```

##### Previous Knowledge

- print statement
- variables and assignments to variables

##### Learning Activities

1) read and run the Python code
2) get an understanding of lines 2-4 - change the value of variable d
3) write line comments
4) realize the type-statement and its result
5) write 2-3 	sentences to answer the question given by the task

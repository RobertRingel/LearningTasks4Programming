## Learning Task: Remove currency exchange data

The following list data structure can be used as a basis for a currency exchange calculation program.

![](CurrencyExchangeCalculator.png)

Implement some lines of Python code to remove the source currency, the destination currency and the exchange rate for an existing currency exchange.  
Finally print the updated list of currencies.

``` python
# data of currencies and rates
currencies = ['EUR','USD',1.12,'USD','EUR',0.91,'YEN','GBP',0.0051]

print('--- Remove currency exhange data ---')

src = input('source currency:')
dest = input('destination currency:')

... complete the code here ...

```

---------------------------------------

### Solution

``` python
# data of currencies and rates
currencies = ['EUR','USD',1.12,'USD','EUR',0.91,'YEN','GBP',0.0051]

print('--- Remove currency exhange data ---')

src = input('source currency:')
dest = input('destination currency:')

src_idx = currencies.index(src)                     # get source curr. index
if src_idx >= 0 and dest == currencies[src_idx+1]:  # check dest. currency
	currencies.pop(src_idx)                         # delete source currency
	currencies.pop(src_idx)                         # delete destination currency
	currencies.pop(src_idx)                         # delete exchange rate
	print(currencies)
else:
	print(src,'is not a source currency.')

```

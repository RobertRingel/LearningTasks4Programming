### Learning Task: Your own data storing program

Write a program, that is able to store data using a dictionary.  
First you need to have an idea, then you should design the propper dictionary data structure - what will be the key and what will be the value?
Then implement the Python program and test it.  
Do not forget to add commentes to your code.

Finally demonstrate your program to another student.

``` python

# ... your coding space ...


```

## Learning Task: Exchange rates

The following Python program can be used to calculate currency exchanges. The
related exchange rates are stored in the text file 'ExchangeRates.txt'.

First open the text file to understand its content. Then read the code and run
it to obtain an understanding. After that, write comments to the lines required 
to read the text file into the list data structure of the program.  
Finally explain your understanding to another student.

If you like, feel free to add some more currency exchange rates to the text file
and check, that they will be read correctly by the Python program.

``` python
currencies = []                    # data of currencies and rates

file_name = 'ExchangeRates.txt'    # name of the text file
rate_file = open(file_name, 'r')

while True:
    line = rate_file.readline()
    if line == '':
        break
    data = line.split(';')
    src = data[0]
    dest = data[1]
    rate = float(data[2])
    currencies.append(src)
    currencies.append(dest)
    currencies.append(rate)

rate_file.close()

# --- core functionalty of the program ---
src = input('From what currency:')
dest = input('To what currency:')

i=0                                         # list index
# loop to loock up the required rate and to perform the calculation
while i<len(currencies):
    if src == currencies[i] and dest == currencies[i+1]:  # currencies found?
        rate = currencies[i+2]                            # yes: get rate
        amount = float(input('Amount:'))                  #      ask for amount
        exchange = amount*rate                            #      calc. exchange
        print('You will get:',exchange,dest)              #      print result
        break                                             #      break loop
    i=i+3                                                 # no:  increment index

if i>=len(currencies):                      # currencies not found
    print('This is not possible.')          #     print message
```

### Solution

``` python
# data of currencies and rates - structure: soure - dest - rate
currencies = []                  

file_name = 'ExchangeRates.txt'    # name of the text file 
rate_file = open(file_name, 'r')   # open text file for reading

while True:
    line = rate_file.readline()    # read a line from the file
    if line == '':
        break                      # break loop in case of empty line
    data = line.split(';')         # split line content by ;
    src = data[0]                  # get source currency
    dest = data[1]                 # get destination currency
    rate = float(data[2])          # get exchange rate as float
    # store all data elements in the list
    currencies.append(src)         
    currencies.append(dest)
    currencies.append(rate)

rate_file.close()                  # close the text file

# --- core functionalty of the program ---
src = input('From what currency:')
dest = input('To what currency:')

i=0     # list index
# loop to loock up the required rate and to perform the calculation
while i<len(currencies):
    if src == currencies[i] and dest == currencies[i+1]:    # currencies found?
        rate = currencies[i+2]                              # yes: get rate
        amount = float(input('Amount:'))                    #      ask for amount
        exchange = amount*rate                              #      calc. exchange
        print('You will get:',exchange,dest)                #      print result
        break                                               #      break loop
    i=i+3                                                   # no:  increment index

if i>=len(currencies):                      # currencies not found
    print('This is not possible.')          #     print message

```

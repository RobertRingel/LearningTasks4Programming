## Learning Task: What is the purpose of the code?

Read, analyse and run the given Python program. What is it's purpose?  
Write the text for a related programming task.

``` python
todo = ['1: water my plants','5: buy movies tickets']

select = ''
while select != '0':
	print()
	print('1: add task  2: remove top task  0: end program')
	select = input('your choice: ')
	
	if select == '1':
		task = input('New task (Prio: Note): ')
		todo.append(task)
		todo.sort()
		print(todo)
	elif select == '2':
		todo.pop(0)
		print(todo)
print('program ended')
```

---------------------------------------

### Solution

*Purpose of the program:*  
The program is used as a task list for prioritized tasks. It can add and remove tasks including a task related priority.

*Programming task*  
Write a Python program to implement a prioritized task list. The user shall be able to add a task to the list or to remove a task from top of the list. After such an action, the program shall print the priority-ranked list of tasks. A task is just a string representing a ToDo-note, where the first character is a digit that stands for the task's priority.

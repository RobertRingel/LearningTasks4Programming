## Learning Task: What is the purpose of the code?

Read, analyse and run the given Python program. What is it's purpose?  
Write the text for a related programming task.

Finally feel free to write comments to the code.

``` python
stud_grade = {'Max':['Math', 2.0, 'Phys', 2.7, 'Chem',1.3], 
              'Liz':['Math', 1.3, 'Phys', 2.0, 'Chem',1.0], 
              'Joe':['Math', 3.0, 'Phys', 2.7, 'Chem',3.3] }

print('--- average student grading ---')
for s in stud_grade.keys():
	gradings = stud_grade.get(s)
	marks = gradings[1::2]
	avg = sum(marks)/len(marks)
	print(s,"%.2f " % avg)
```

---------------------------------------

### Solution

*Purpose of the program:*  
The program is used to calculate the average student grading based on the list of exam marks for each student.

*Programming task*  
Write a Python program to calculate the average student grading based on the list of exam marks for each student. Use a dictionary data structure to store the lecture names and the exam marks as a list related to every student's name.
Use the following print statement to print just two decimals for the calculated average grading: print("%.2f " % avg)

#### Previous Knowledge

vcp-1, vcp-3: variable, calculations, formatted printing  
list-1, list-3: basic list, for-iteration, list slicing  
dict-2, dict-3: get all dictionary keys, dictionary stores lists  

#### Learning Activities

1) reading and running Python code
2) explain the purpose in a short and specific written statement
3) write a short and specific programming task, that yields the given Python code

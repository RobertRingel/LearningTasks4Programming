### Learning Task: Wrong file name

The given Python code will read the content of the text file 'ExchangeRates.txt'. Unfortunately there is a typo in the file name causing the program to crash.  
Add the appropriate exception handling to prevent the program crash when a named file is not available. In such a situation print a warning to the user.  
Improve the given code in a way, that reading and closing the file will only be performed, if the file was opened successfully.
Finally run the program to proof the functionality of your implementation.  

``` python
file_name = 'ExchangeRateS.txt'      # the file name
rates_file = open(file_name, 'r')    # open file for reading
while True:                          # read file line by line
    line = rates_file.readline()     # read one line from the file
    if line == '':                   # empty line -> terminate reading
        break
    print(line)                      # print line

rates_file.close()                   # close text file                   
```

##### Solution

``` python
file_name = 'ExchangeRateS.txt'              # the file name
error = False                                # error state variable
try:
	rates_file = open(file_name, 'r')        # open file for reading
except Exception as e:
	print('Error opening file:'+file_name)   # print error message
	print(e)
	error = True                             # set the error state

while not error:                             # no error: read file line by line
    line = rates_file.readline()             #   read one line from the file
    if line == '':                           #   empty line -> terminate reading
        break
    print(line)                              #   print line

if not error:                                # no error:
	rates_file.close()                       #    close text file
```

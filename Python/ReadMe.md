This task pool provides a set of learning tasks for learning Python programming. It contains 109 tasks (February 2025).
The numbering schema of the different task sets is related to their content. Following the sequence of numbers results in a task sequence
to start from very basic topics towards the more and more advanced ones.

The content of the task pool currently covers the following topics:
- Input Processing Output  
- Execution Control (Branches, Loops)
- Data Structures (List, Tupel, Dictionary)
- Functions and Modules  
- Processing text files
- Exception handling
